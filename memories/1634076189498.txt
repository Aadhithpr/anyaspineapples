«Ok so one long message for you coming up »• if I'm being
 practical you should know that I have no life and no idea 
of what I'm gonna
 do all of my plans are just falling apart and it's just not fair
 to you because maybe you wanna help but I just can't let you.»»• you are 
everything thing I've ever wanted you are perfect in every 
way and sometimes it just feels too good to be true and even more considering
 you actually like me and I'm scared that you have a great 
potential to shatter my heart beyond recovery (wow that was
 poetic (cheesy i mean))
and maybe I don't wanna give you that chance.»»•and that is
 why I like things the way it is now with us and not complicate anything and I 
think we are doing great  just like this and this way it'll hurt
 way less if something ever went wrong wow I'm coming of as a wuss but cut me
 some slack ok I've never experienced anything like this(us) 
before and it's so special.»»•also just to put it out there I have thought about 
kissing you multiple times and went over what it'd be like If 
we ever met but then I think its creepy and I just try forgetting it and why 
I haven't told you about it.»»•i guess there's more to it but
 idk them yet I'm telling you all this atleast because you deserve
 to know 
after all the the times I've rejected you » »so tl;dr I'm a wuss but
 I love you (there i said it) and I don't know what to do pretty sure
 you don't either and probably be so overwhelmed after reading
 this and I'm really sorry if I've hurt you when I denied your love » »
and damn what a load of crap I've written and pls don't wake up
 to this ping itll be so embarrassing
